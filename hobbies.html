	<h2> My Hobbies/Interests</h2>
	<p><strong>Drawing/Painting</strong></p>
	<p> I enjoy making art of any kind, but in particular I enjoy drawing and painting. The main subjects of my art are people. I enjoy drawing people and creating characters. The main supplies/ medias that I use include pencil/graphite drawings, watercolor paints, and ink. I have been creating art since the age of 6 years old and I have grown to enjoy it more and more.</p>
