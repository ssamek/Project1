	<p>Quadeca is an American rapper, singer-songwriter and former Youtuber. He began releasing music in 2015 at the age of 14. He released 3 mixtapes before releasing a debut studio album in 2019 called "Voice Memos".</p>

	<p><strong> Personal Favorites</strong></p>
	<p> My favorite album that has been released by Quadeca is "From Me to You" because of the style of the music and how the whole album flows together. In specific, my favorite song from the album is "Sisyphus" because of the sound. My favorite song from all his releases is "knots" from the album "I Didn't Mean to Haunt You" because of the instrumentals and unique sound.</p>
